<b>Project Inspiration</b>

This project was inspired through my passion and interest in music and concerts! I am electronic music fan and am fascinated by how festivals
and conercts are able to use visuals, lights, props, and music to create an experience where fans can be transforted to a new world. In addition,
my passion for technology has also made me interested in the future of VR. This project combines these interests of mine to recreate a concert venue.

<b>Project Technologies:</b>
1. Unity
2. Maya

<b>Features:</b>
1. Users can walk around the venue and interact with the environment
2. Users can trigger visual effects
3. XR controls implemented to simulate VR controls

<b>Visual Effects</b>

Visual effects can be triggered through certain buttons. The scripts folder in this repository has the code that allow these effects to work. 
The following effects were impleneted in this project:
1. Pyrotechnics
2. Fog Machine
3. LED Screen/LED Wheel strobe
4. Roof Spotlights
5. Front Stage Spotlights

<b>XR Controls</b>

XR controls were implemented in this project through a third party VR simulator. The controls allows the users to grab items, drop them, or point and shoot at them.
I did not have a VR headset while creating this project and would have impleneted/refactored code to make it more VR-friendly.

<b>Maya Assets</b>

A majority of the assets in this project were made by myself in Maya. Things such as wall and floor materials were either created in Unity or through a third party
materials pack. Most of the Maya assets I created can be found in the Concert Venue Custom Assets folder of this repository. Below are some examples:
